This is an excerpt from the sv.c file:

    An SV (or AV, HV, etc.) is allocated in two parts: the head (struct
    sv, av, hv...) contains type and reference count information, and for
    many types, a pointer to the body (struct xrv, xpv, xpviv...), which
    contains fields specific to each type.  Some types store all they need
    in the head, so don't have a body.

Does a SVIV have a body?

    An SVIV is an integer scalar value.
    They did have a body prior to Perl 5.9.2, but no longer have it since then.

What does it mean for a SV to have a body?

    The head will contain a reference to another structure representing the body.
    The body contains fields specific to each type.

What does the SVIV structure consist of?

    It consists of a SvANY pointer such that instead of pointing to a
    real body, it points into the memory before the location of the
    head. We compute this pointer such that the location of
    the integer member of the hypothetical body struct happens to
    be the same as the location of the integer member of the bodyless
    SV head.
